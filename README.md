# Resume-Parser-and-Job-Matcher

Group Members: Brandon Cheung, Devarsh Shah, Nicole Chen

## Project Goal
Job searching has become overwhelmingâ€”visiting multiple sites, scrolling through pages, and manually identifying relevant roles is time-consuming. Resume Parser & Job Matcher automates this process by:

1. Parsing resume PDFs to extract skills and experience
2. Embedding both resumes and job descriptions into 384-dimensional vectors via Sentence-BERT
3. Matching candidates to jobs using both cosine similarity and FAISS for real-time nearest-neighbor searches
4. Our goal is to make the job hunt faster, easier, and more accurate.

## Dataset Details
We use two Kaggle datasets primarily:

Job Postings: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings
Resume Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset
## Please refer to our Final Project Report for more details and results.
